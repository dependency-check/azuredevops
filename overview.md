# OWASP Dependency Check

Dependency-Check is a software composition analysis utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly disclosed, vulnerabilities. Currently, Java and .NET are supported; additional experimental support has been added for Ruby, Node.js, Python, and limited support for C/C++ build systems (autoconf and cmake). The tool can be part of a solution to the [OWASP Top 10 2017 A9-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities) previously known as [OWASP Top 10 2013 A9-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).

The OWASP Dependency Check Azure DevOps Extension enables the following features in an Azure Build Pipeline:

- Software composition analysis runs against package references during build on both Windows and Linux build agents.

- Export vulnerability data to HTML, JSON, XML, CSV, JUnit, Sarif formatted reports

- Download vulnerability reports from the build's artifacts

## SARIF display in Summary

You can display the dependency check report nicely in your Pipeline run summary. To realize it set `format` to `sarif` and make sure your Azure DevOps organization has [SARIF SAST Scans Tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sariftools.scans) extension installed.
